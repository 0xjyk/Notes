## Introduction to Objects
All programming languages provide abstraction.  
What really matters is the kind and quality of abstraction. Kind implies "What is it that is being abstracted". 
The Object-oriented approach allows the programmer to model the solution based on the problem space. The elemets of the problem state are known as "Objects" in the solution space. 
As the book puts it 
> The idea is that the program is allowed to adapt itself to the lingo of the problem by adding new types of objects, so when you read the code describing the solution, you're reading words that also express the problem. 
Features of Object-oriented programming 
1. Everything is an object 
2. A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages
3. Each object has its own memory made up of other objects
4. Every object has a type
5. All object of a particular type can receive the same messages
